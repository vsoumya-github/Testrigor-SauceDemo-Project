## âœ¨ Personal Statement

This project marks an important milestone in my journey to re-enter the tech industry after a career break. I selected this Test Automation project using testRigor to refresh and apply my QA skills in a modern, AI-supported environment.

The hands-on experience with testRigor allowed me to explore no-code/low-code test automation approaches, generate real-world test cases, and understand how AI can improve efficiency in functional testing. It has re-energized my passion for Quality Assurance and reaffirmed my commitment to continuous learning.

This project is a stepping stone towards more complex automation frameworks and reflects my readiness to contribute meaningfully to QA teams in todayâ€™s tech landscape.
